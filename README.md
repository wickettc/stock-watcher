Welcome to The Stock Watcher!

This project is a stock market watching application created with VueJS and uses the TwelveData API. Vuex manages the application state (SOOOOO much better than Redux) and VueRouter handles routing!

I ended up using Firebase for authentication and the cloud firestore for my DB on this project. I had never used firebase before and figured since the backend was going to be pretty simple on this project, why not give it a shot. I have to say firebase is incredibly convenient, easy to set up, and is a great tool to have in the belt!

Personal Note:

I personally believe that every person should spend a little time learning how the market works, even if you don't plan on managing your funds/stocks personally, it is ALWAYS a good idea to understand the basics. Financial freedom is life changing, and one of the best ways to get there is through the stock market. That is what inspired me to create this application! I hope you enjoy!
