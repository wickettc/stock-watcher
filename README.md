This project will be a stock market watching application created with VueJS and utilizing the TwelveData API. I plan on using vuex to manage state and the vue router.
Still working through all the features I want to add, I would also like to expand the app at some point and create a backend where users can log in and get a customized view of the stocks they are watching.
